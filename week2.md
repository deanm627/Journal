It's been two weeks since starting the bootcamp, and I've already learned so much.  The dots are beginning to connect and I'm feeling more comfortable with the coding environment and tools.  I was initially on the fence about whether I should do the bootcamp or learn on my own, but I know now it was the right decision to enroll in the bootcamp.  It's been very valuable to have an instructor like Sean who has a great deal of experience and can teach concepts in person so they are easier to understand.  I like that he knows a lot of the history because it helps to grasp the overall picture when you know the history.  It's been super helpful that he and Isaac are available to answer questions.  It's also nice to have classmates who are on a similar journey.  Overall I'm just really enjoying it and looking forward to learning more in the weeks to come.
